# DSC180A Project Git Repository
## Getting Started
To build the environment, run: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

## Quarter 1 Project Objective:
Build a score to predict the risk of a consumer not paying their bills

## Current Progress:
In order to create a risk assessment score, our group is currently focusing on creating a model to accurately determine the category of a transaction based on the transaction memo. 

To recreate any models we built, build the environment using the command found in 'Getting Started' and run the notebook 'model_testing.ipynb'.
