# DSC180A Project Git Repository
## Getting Started
To build the environment, run: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

## Quarter 1 Project Objective:
Build a score to predict the risk of a consumer not paying their bills

## Current Progress:
In order to create a risk assessment score, our group is currently focusing on creating a model to accurately determine the category of a transaction based on the transaction memo. 

To recreate any models we built, build the environment using the command found in 'Getting Started' and run the notebook 'model_testing.ipynb'.

The dataset has been removed since the git repo became public for Checkpoint #1, but models trained are still stored in 'src/models' and all progress made on creating a BERT model to classify memos can be found in 'notebook/model_testing.ipynb'
