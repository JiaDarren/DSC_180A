# DSC180 Project Git Repository
## Getting Started:
To build the environment, run: 'pip install -r requirements.txt'

To see current progress, run 'risk_predictor.ipynb' in the notebooks folder.

## Quarter 2 Project Objective:
Build a score to predict a given consumer's default risk based on their banking transaction history

## Current Progress:
During Quarter 1, we built several models to categorize inflow and outflow transactions based on the transaction memo. Now, using those categorizations, the date of each transaction, and some other data provided in the datasets, we are attempting to build a model to predict whether a consumer will default on their first loan payment, given their previous transaction history.
